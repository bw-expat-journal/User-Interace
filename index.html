        <h3>About Journaling</h3>
        <p class="justify">Journaling is a well established, proven tool for optimizing all your positive daily actions - effectively a 'secret sauce' for successful transitions.</p>
        <p class="justify">In a world that is overpoweringly focused on 'input' - your Facebook feeds, your email inbox, your day to day work and social interactions, journaling is a place where you can focus on your own creative or developmental 'output' - what happened, and how you reacted. Ever better, it does so quietly, privately and independently, so you can use it whenever, wherever you are. It helps you to take a step back and identify what's important to you, where you want to see change, and where you can acknowledge the negative in your environment, interactions and responses, and explore changes that you want to make. </p>
        <p class="justify">We develop Guided Journals to support your wellbeing, growth and development throughout your global journey, whether this is your first, fifth or final move. We know that journaling is a critical skill for those of us living in transition, helping us to navigate continents, cultures, and challenges successfully. Whether you choose the original Finding Home Abroad book or our new interactive mobile version, the questions and insights will simplify and open up the journaling process for you, guiding you as you explore your experiences and helping you to find clarity and build confidence in the unfamiliar. For those who regularly journal, those who have never journaled before, or those who want to help others through their global transitions, we're looking forward to meeting with you and sharing the power of journaling.</p>

            <p class="justify">Starting with a beautiful custom journaling toolkit, we follow up with a tailored series of prompts delivered to your inbox at a rate to suit you. The questions and insights encourage you to observe, (internally and externally), reflect, and embrace new perspectives, cross cultural skills and your personal experiences. They help you through the well-documented passages of highs and lows, anticipation, frustration, disillusionment, excitement, sense of accomplishment and moments of self doubt. The process of international relocation and transition is often described as a rollercoaster, and we help you stay positive, adapt successfully and cross cultures with clarity and confidence.</p>
